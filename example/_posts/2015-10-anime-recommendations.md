It’s time for EGOIST to take you to the new section. This year’s October new season is still in line with my taste. I will recommend some of the games I am chasing from Monday to Sunday.

## <span>Monday</span>

I only recommend one, "One Punch Superman." I haven't seen the comics, but the punches are quite funny, and I have enough to watch the meat and sell it.

## <span>Tuesday</span>

Boring days, no recommendations.

## <span>Wednesday</span>

There is no doubt that there is a "about me being kidnapped to a noble female school as a sample of the public." Let me ignore it and look at the picture.

## <span>Thursday</span>

Still boring.

## <span>Friday</span>

The work of the goddess of manga, "The Black Jack of Youth", I have seen less in medicine. This soundtrack and plot are very different in that era.

## <span>Saturday</span>

"The new sister devil's contractor BURST" I saw the first issue, I saw that I was stoned, so I continued to chase.

"Reloading weapons" is of course a cute woman, a little Loli.

"I am a hero of the Lost Knights", I am a sister, and I like to dedicate myself to my sister.

## <span>Sunday</span>

I didn't read the predecessor of "The false face of the rumored thing". I didn't feel that it was suitable for me when I looked at the painting style a little. But I like this period of cat ears.

"The Ending Blazing Angels Phase 2", the characters are very interesting. Although the paintings and plots are seriously spit, the people are still very classic. Well, I just like Queen Cluru 233.

"Immediate! Giants High School" is really crying me, and my first goddess Mikhasha.

Specially attached to "Women's Drive", you don't have the light of the Holy Light.
