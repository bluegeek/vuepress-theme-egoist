The first day of the National Day is coming to an end, that is to say, the new fan in July this year has also become old. The days when the weekends were not updated were quite difficult. Write a review and pass the time.

At the beginning of this season, what attracted me most was the ** "The boring world without the existence of the yellow section"**. In the introduction of the new fan before July, I probably ignored this anime directly. I thought it was boring and funny. Ignore it, although it is really funny, but it is very refreshing the lower limit of my exercise, opening the door to the new world for me, so it becomes my weekly chase. Whether it is the laughter of the teacher or the sister juice of Anna's predecessors, I am full of expectations for each episode.


Let's talk about ** "Queen of the package" ** and ** "My wife is the president of the student" **, no doubt this is what I must chase every week, the reason is obvious, no revision is a gift from God.

** "The Spirit of the Restaurant" ** not in the last season ** I am a type of Meng female lord, this kind of black long arrogant attribute cold type is too much damage to me, can not stop.

Look at the ** "dry little girl buried" ** Xiao buried completely because I saw a lot of people's praise, I couldn't make any effort on this kind of waste, but after I saw one or two episodes, I also bought potato chips cola two All three days have been completed. Now every Thursday night turns into my little night, never feels that the potato chips and cola are so enticing, is this a piece of music not a good thing? XD

** "Magic Girl Elia" ** and ** "Red Hair White Snow Ji" ** The first few episodes are quite interesting, and I can't catch up after watching.

** "Prison Academy" ** Nothing cute, but the flower room sister's health room play really made me die, this is not such a charming flower school sister can not imagine! We pursued for the welfare comics animation of flower school sister.

** "Dragon Ball Super" ** is also what I am looking forward to. After all, I like the Dragon Ball series very much. At the beginning, it is similar to God and God. There should be more exciting development in the back.

For the big devil's ** "Charlotte" ** is naturally the sound of Tucao, in short, too many dragons and God's jumping story made me want a lot of desire to send a blade. The ending is also unable to vomit, although it is a happy end for the male owner, but it is too reluctant ending. In the early days of the day, the reversal of the film to save the world can be counted as rotten films. I am not talking about the "sinful crown" because it does not have too many dragon plots, disappearing characters and strange plot development. Besides, the sin crown on the soundtrack is enough for you to replay a hundred times. So Charlotte is undoubtedly another rotten film that the audience is willing to watch.

The above is the review of the July New Fan. There is nothing to be interested in the October New Fan, except for the ** "One Punch Superman" ** and the ** "The Ending Blazing Angel" ** the second half. I think about the new fan in October last year. ** "Parasitic Beast"** and ** "Tokyo Ghoul"** I really blasted my October, will there be such a good October?

No, maybe.
