Everything that is long will eventually come apart, separate from the mother, and be isolated from each other, but the process is slow and repeated.

The first time I felt long, it was on a slope. The top-down glide kept me in sync with time. It was a long time for me and my childhood friends. It was like the summer of the year. The sun is generally indelible and seems to be going on all the time.

The second long time, it is not very glorious, it is a long time under the desk. In the days after the roller skating, my courage didn't get any exercise. It wasn't a long-term thing to not go to the medical examination under the desk, but urinating is something that everyone can't do. In the end, I didn't hold back. I was brought back to my home by the teacher and my older sister in the upper grades. The urinary door became one of the laughing points that I was teased by my sister in the future.

The third long time is that I am a little older, fifth grade. Several TV station sisters came to the school to find a small reporter for the sports meeting, so there was an interview that everyone could attend. And I also went.

Maybe when I was a child, I was a child who thought I was very energetic. I was observing the interview situation of each of my classmates before, and now I know that I just thought that only I would do this.

The classmate in front of me is also the best friend of my elementary school. His interview gave me a sentence that I thought was the most useful. "Children, when you talk later, you have to look at other people's eyes~". So, I seem to emphasize that I have a pair of "big bang" eyes, it is my turn, I just watched the TV station's sister. My sister seemed to know something. Even though I didn't pass it, I gave it a chance to let me write a sports report for her to see. For the first time, I felt the reward that sincerely brought me. As for the so-called long, but when I saw my sister's eyes have me, the time is still gentle.

There are still a lot of long things. These three paragraphs of life may not be the most memorable, but they are first recalled.
