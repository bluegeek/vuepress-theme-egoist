### Re: Different world life from scratch

As the name suggests, this is the adventure of the "different world." In short, it is a "crossing class" plot. I don't know which force manipulates the male master from modern times to a time that is suspected of the Middle Ages. It seems that the male lord has also been given some power...

### 100 Armed Wars

This is a adaptation of a "fantasy" light novel. Humans rely on weapons called "Hundred Arms" to fight aliens, and the male-loving males enter the college to strengthen the stalks of the harem.


## <span>Wednesday</span>

### 双星之阴阳师

The painting style is slightly curious, and the plot is very Chinese. Probably the story of the strongest "Yin and Yang" who was awakened by the female host after a major blow to decadence, and then I guess it should be a variety of battles with "dirty".

No, study hard.

### In the next transcript, what are you doing?

In April, I was forced to play the strongest. After reading "Sakamoto," I made up for him to fight with "One Punch Superman". The picture is so beautiful. In short, Sakamoto is a perfect thing to do, "suspected aliens", and is loved by people in school at the age of "no matter men, women, young and old." Laughing.

### Online game wife can't be a girl

I have only seen a little comics and the first episode of the TV version. It is probably a type of "fantasy" + "campus". It is also possible to develop into a "harem". Students who like "Sword Art Online" can look at it.

### Kabanely of Iron City

The April funding was burning. OP is sung by Eimist and ED by Aimer, and the music is produced by Sawano Hiroyuki. This is destined that at least the music part of this piece will be as impressive as the "Sin Crown", and it is true in the performance of the first episode. There is even a BGM suspected of "hanging the Divine Comedy"!

The plot is also going to the "God" route. "Zombie Besieged City" thinks about it. I feel that it is more creepy than the "Attacking Giant" and there is a possibility of being banned. Character design is also very good, the female owner seems to have the ability to be different from ordinary people, the feet look good, and the male owner is suspected to be the second middle school of high IQ. Both auditory and visual, the plot does not seem to be good, will it be God?

In short, I am quite looking forward to the subsequent development.

### Reverse referee

Cheng Bu Tang Long Yi (referred to as Jackie Chan) is a lawyer who rides a children's bicycle back and forth at home and in the court, and fights with a savage gangster and prosecutor, and has a wonderful story.

### Ninja Killer SE

Another laugh in April is that it is different from the style of painting. This unique "PPT style" seems to save money but brings unexpected laughter. The plot is also obvious, and the dead will be resurrected by the former ninja. The man who was killed by the ninja was possessed by a mysterious ninja soul and began the road of destroying the "ninja". The only normal thing about this time is the painting of female characters. Both the shape and the amount of milk are very normal and beautiful.
