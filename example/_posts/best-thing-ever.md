Wang Xiaobo said that the pleasure of being deprived of thinking is a matter of falling, so watching the most interesting thing on this planet is in any case worth trying.

The most interesting thing is not that the name is so bad. I didn't mean to look at the animation on the air. I didn't mean it at all. You can't admit it, but it's best not to refute it. Interesting things are not the same, but there is nothing new in the sun. My dad’s interesting thing when he was young is to watch Jin Yong’s martial arts novels. Wang Xiaobo thinks that having a book is the happiest and most interesting, but it can’t be Xiaohongshu, "The fun of being imprisoned" is worse than letting him die.

Equally interesting is that things haven't changed unexpectedly, and what we find interesting is still the same essence. Now I am happy to watch animation. The interesting places are not experienced by people who don't see it, and even ambiguous. For example, my dad is, "Is it big to watch cartoons?" This is a complaint I recently received, I don't think so.

Anything can be completely opposite. "Returning to the truth" can get a "naive" and "boring" response. It is difficult for you to explain to the opposite person some obvious but benevolent things.

But the first fun in the world is irresistible.

Just like being a person is naturally quite interesting, but some people think that it is also very interesting to be a cat to be a dog. In this case, I naturally would not argue with them. After all, there will be two species of reproductive isolation soon. There is no need for emotional exchanges.
